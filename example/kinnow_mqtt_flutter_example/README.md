# Kinnow MQTT üçä flutter client example
A Desktop Mqtt 5 Client built using Kinnow MQTT. The project aims to represent the core capabilities 
of Kinnow Mqtt and does not aim to be a full blown desktop MQTT Client. As such it lacks some quality 
of life features that one expects to find in a full blown desktop Mqtt Client (like filtering by topic etc)

Ready to use packages are available from the Releases section of the Github Repository
