Kinnow Mqtt client functions will return any corresponding acknowledgement packets. For example calling subscribe will return the SubAck Packet sent by the broker, A publishQos1 call will return the PubAck. For events that occur without any calls such as ping requests and ping response, An event stream is provided

### 3. Built for Unreliable Networks
The library is built with unreliable networks in mind. The client ensures that operations are completed regardless of connection state. This means the user doesn't need to monitor the connection status before starting any operation
